# ADFT v1.0

ADFT is an offline Active Directory / Windows investigation toolkit with an integrated local web UI.

This official v1.0 release ships one coherent product surface:

- the canonical ADFT engine
- the CLI
- the integrated GUI served by the backend

ADFT ingests exported evidence, converts every supported source into canonical JSONL, applies deterministic detections and correlations, computes an observed AD exposure score, reconstructs attack progression, and generates investigation and hardening artefacts.

## Quick overview

ADFT analyzes offline Windows / AD / SIEM-oriented datasets and produces investigation artifacts through a CLI and an integrated GUI.

![ADFT CLI summary](docs/screenshots/04-benchmark.png)

## Scope of v1.0

ADFT v1.0 supports:

- canonical JSONL conversion
- offline investigation from exported evidence
- deterministic detections and correlations
- timeline reconstruction and attack-path rendering
- observed AD exposure scoring
- hardening findings and optional PowerShell remediation exports
- report artefacts in HTML, JSON and CSV
- ATT&CK Navigator, replay JSON, Mermaid graph and integrity manifest exports
- an integrated local web UI served by the backend
- a benchmark view in the GUI for release validation and runtime checks

## Supported input formats

ADFT accepts source evidence in multiple formats and converts them to canonical JSONL before analysis:

- JSON / JSONL / NDJSON
- EVTX
- YAML / YML
- CSV / TSV
- CEF / LEEF
- XML
- LOG / SYSLOG / TXT
- Markdown
- ZIP

## Installation

Recommended one-shot install:

```bash
./install_adft.sh
```

Recommended for real EVTX validation:

```bash
./install_adft.sh --run-demo
```

Manual installation:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e ".[full]"
```

Development installation:

```bash
pip install -e ".[full,dev]"
```

Detailed dependency notes are listed in `docs/DEPENDENCIES.md`.

Repository note: `pyproject.toml` is the source of truth for packaging. `install_adft.sh` is the official complete installation path for v1.0, and `requirements-dev.txt` remains available for contributors and CI.

## Main commands

```bash
adft convert test_logs -o converted_inputs
adft investigate test_logs/attack.json -o reports_core --format html json csv --export-events-jsonl
adft summary -o reports_core
adft alerts -o reports_core --full
adft score -o reports_core
adft story -o reports_core --full
adft attack-chain -o reports_core
adft attack-path -o reports_core
adft reconstruct -o reports_core --full
adft harden -o reports_core --dry-run --export-scripts reports_core/remediation
adft report -o reports_core
```

## Integrated GUI

Launch the integrated GUI with:

```bash
adft ui -o reports_gui --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8765
```

Then open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8765
```
![ADFT Benchmark](docs/screenshots/01-cli-summary.png)

The GUI is backend-driven: uploads, conversion, investigation, alerts, timeline, reconstruction, graph, benchmark, hardening and export views read the real ADFT run state instead of replaying business logic in the browser.

### Current GUI characteristics

- browser tab title and icon branded as **ADFT UI**
- static assets served with no-cache headers
- working refresh action against backend state and capabilities
- centered entity graph with pan, zoom, node drag, directed edges and time-window filtering
- node enrichment with risk, first-seen / last-seen and known-IOC marking when evidence exists
- bounded graph display with max-50 node pagination to reduce analyst noise
- benchmark tab for runtime and release validation

## Graph-based pivoting

ADFT supports graph-based investigation from a selected pivot, with visible relationships, time scoping, and analyst-oriented navigation.

## Generated artefacts

- `adft_report.html`
- `adft_report.json`
- `adft_report.csv`
- `attack_navigator_layer.json`
- `adft_replay.json`
- `attack_graph.mmd`
- `adft_integrity.json`
- `.adft_last_run.json`
- `converted_inputs/conversion_manifest.json`
- `hardening_scripts.zip` after GUI or CLI hardening export

## EVTX dependency note

EVTX is part of the supported perimeter.
At runtime, EVTX conversion requires `python-evtx`.

Without it, EVTX inputs cannot be parsed successfully.
That is why the recommended install path for the official v1.0 release is:

```bash
./install_adft.sh
```

## Rulepack

This v1.0 release ships with **34 rules** in a deterministic, explainable pipeline.

## Benchmark and validation

## UI language toggle

The integrated GUI includes a persistent FR/EN language switch in the top bar. The choice is stored locally in the browser and applies to the main navigation, screens and analyst-facing labels.


## Demo dataset

ADFT v1.0 ships with `adft/datasets/ad_prod_investigation_post_siem_demo_1000_events.json` for an end-to-end ransomware demonstration that exercises conversion, timeline, graph, alerts and exports.
